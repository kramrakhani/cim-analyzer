DIRECT MARKETING STRATEGY

While many industries have moved away from direct mail marketing, it is still an
important way to reach prospects within the senior living industry

The key to a successful direct mail marketing initiative is the ability to develop a
strategic creative piece that appeals to the right audience and motivates them to
take the defined action

Attane licenses a detailed prospect list for each client, which it then uses to plan
direct mail initiatives, the Company’s list uses 17 different criteria (e.g., age, home
value, etc.) to define the ideal resident

The list is licensed from Epsilon and then clients can subscribe to the list service,
limiting the client’s access

The Company’s subscription list replaces up to 30% of records annually,
maximizing ROI

The list also generated a 2.8% direct mail response rate for an Attane client
compared to other generic lists from competitors in the market that generate a
0.15% - 0.5% response rate

COMMENTARY

+ Despite the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA forecasted in 2023F, Attane has returned to its higher-touch, customized lead generation strategies and is confident in its ability to cost-effectively re-
engage with prior clients and capitalize on new growth opportunities

* Management took action to mitigate the impact of lost revenue by reducing operating expenses, which was mostly driven by headcount reductions that led to lower employee costs coupled with
reassessing its technology portfolio and lower corporate costs

* Additionally, the Company has layered in pro-forma adjustments related to the additional headcount instantiates scheduled to take place the 1H’23 and facility costs, which have resulted in a
$7.1MM increase in EBITDA adjustments compared to 2022A, which included a negative adjustment of $5.6MM related to an ERTC that was booked as a receivable and is related to non-
operating income
